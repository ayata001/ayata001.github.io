        <div class="subheading mb-5">History Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a full-time student currently attending the University of California, Riverside.
          As a History major, I hope to one day become an archivist for a museum or other research facility. As an avid
          reader and writing enthusiast, this study and profession offers the opportunity to perform at my highest potential.<br><br>

          After entering the job market during my senior year of high school, I have since gained experience working
          in the food and service industry. At the moment, I have maintained a shift lead position at Ginkgo Katsu—a
          Japanese-Korean fusion restaurant. Having worked at Gingko Katsu for around two years, my typical
          responsibilities involve general store management such as restocking housemade teas, toppings, sauces and
          more, in addition to ensuring coworkers are sent out on appropriate break times. Furthermore, I am tasked
          with both delivering and packaging catering orders as well as maintaining customer satisfaction. Due to
          my work at Gingko, I have also become more adept at kiosk appliances and cashiering as daily register and
          safe maintenance/attendance is required. Moreover, my position requires me to keep in close contact with
          the store owners and managers, which has also allowed me to exercise and enhance my communication skills.

          In high school, I was able to lay the foundation for the organizational and communication skills which
          have allowed me to better perform at my current job as a shift lead. A large contributor for these
          attributes is my work on my high school newspaper, The Bull’s Eye. I started out my career within the
          publication as an Assistant News Editor in my sophomore year, eventually being promoted to the News
          Editor position my junior year and finally serving as both Art and Entertainment Editor in addition to
          Editor in Chief of the publication. As an editor, I was tasked with drafting and finalizing story ideas,
          including the photos used alongside them, as well as managing the overall layout of the page. As such, it
          was important for me to remain in constant communication with fellow editors, to ensure story ideas did
          not clash so that our final paper would provide more diverse content. Furthermore, I was in charge of
          both delegating tasks among my assistants, and communicating with story-writers for my section to ensure
          deadlines were met. Moreover, editors partook in a monthly editorial piece in which an argument was formed
          collaboratively to represent the view of the publication as a whole, on a given topic. As Editor in Chief,
          my responsibilities were expanded past a singular section, to all sections of the paper. Additionally,
          I was in charge of organizing the final pages of our publication and sending them to our publishers. This
          also included keeping in close contact with the Business section of our paper to ensure we maintained proper
          funding to afford the printing of our paper. Whatsmore, every month I was entrusted to submit an evaluation
          of the entire staff, as well as evaluations of each page of the paper to ensure our staff maintained the
          quality of their work.
          <br><br>

          In both my work and educational experiences, leadership and teamwork have been at the forefront of
          their execution and fulfillment. As such, my current skill set revolves around these realms. In the
          future, I hope to apply these attributes to my work in History, specifically as an archivist as the
          profession requires personal management skills, which I feel my experiences have begun to prepare me for.
